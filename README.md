# Meteor.Net
A simple Meteor DDP implementation `ported` from [sgaluza/Meteor.DDP](https://github.com/sgaluza/Meteor.DDP)

This new version is most for updating the dependencies. The original project is based on .Net FX and some old version of other nuget packages. Due to the raise of .Net Core and that Microsoft is going to merge everything into .Net Core and WinUI, I feel like using a library based on .Net FX is not the best practice.

This project is currently based on .Net Core 3.0 preview 7. Bugs are expected. However, as .Net Core move forward, this project will move forward with it.
